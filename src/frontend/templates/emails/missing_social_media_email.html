    <h1>Hi {{ guest_name }},</h1>
    <p>
      You forgot to provide some of your social media handles, so we canâ€™t tag
      you in the posts we do to promote you and your episode with
      <strong>{{ podName }}</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please reply with the missing handles for
      <strong>{{ social_network }}</strong> so we can update your episode
      details and make sure you get some good promotion through our network.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you don't use these social networks, that's not a problem. We just want
      to make sure you get the most out of this collaboration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, don't forget to connect and tag <strong>Karl Lillrud</strong> in the
      posts you create.
    </p>
    <p>Thank you!</p>
    <p>Best regards,<br />{{ podName }}</p>
