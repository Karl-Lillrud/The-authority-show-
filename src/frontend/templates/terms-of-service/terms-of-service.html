      <p>
        By using PodManager, you agree to the following terms and conditions related to payments. These terms govern all payments made through Stripe, our selected payment processor.
      </p>

      <h3>10.1 Payment Methods</h3>
      <p>
        We accept payments via credit cards, Google Pay, and Stripe's Link. These payment methods are powered by Stripe to ensure secure and reliable transactions. By providing your payment information, you authorize PodManager to charge the payment method you have selected for the services provided.
      </p>

      <h3>10.2 Subscriptions</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Monthly Subscriptions:</strong> Monthly subscriptions are available, and users can cancel their subscription at any time. Upon cancellation, users will retain access to the service until the end of the current billing period.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Yearly Subscriptions:</strong> Yearly subscriptions are available at a discounted rate. Users have the option to disable auto-renewal for the next billing cycle. If auto-renewal is disabled, the subscription will not renew at the end of the yearly period, and users will retain access until the end of the current term.
      </p>

      <h3>10.3 Credit Packs</h3>
      <p>
        Credit Packs are purchased separately from subscriptions. These credits are used for additional services, such as extra episode slots. Once purchased, Credit Packs are non-refundable. By purchasing credits, you acknowledge that there will be no refunds or exchanges for any unused credits.
      </p>

      <h3>10.4 Extra Episode Slots</h3>
      <p>
        Extra episode slots can be purchased using either Credit Packs or direct payments. Once a slot is purchased, it is considered final and non-refundable.
      </p>

      <h3>10.5 Billing and Charges</h3>
      <p>
        All payments are processed through Stripe and are subject to Stripe's terms and conditions. PodManager does not store your payment information. Your billing cycle will begin upon the completion of the payment and will be automatically charged based on the chosen subscription term (monthly or yearly).
      </p>

      <h3>10.6 Payment Security</h3>
      <p>
        Payments made through Stripe are encrypted and processed in compliance with Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS). We take your privacy and security seriously and ensure that all transactions are secure.
      </p>

      <h3>10.7 Taxes</h3>
      <p>
        All payments made are exclusive of applicable taxes. Depending on your location, taxes may apply to the charges, and these will be added to your total during checkout.
      </p>

      <h3>10.8 Modifications</h3>
      <p>
        We reserve the right to modify these payment terms or pricing structures at any time. Any changes will be communicated via email or on our website, and they will be effective immediately unless otherwise stated.
      </p>

      <h3>10.9 Disputes and Chargebacks</h3>
      <p>
        In case of any disputes or chargebacks, we request that you first reach out to Podmanager's customer support. We will work with you to resolve any issues regarding payment or service access. Should a chargeback be initiated without prior communication, access to your account may be suspended until the dispute is resolved.
